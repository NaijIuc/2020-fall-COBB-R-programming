# R Programming<img src="https://www.r-project.org/Rlogo.png" alt="1024px-R_logo.svg" align="right" alt="" height="60" />

This is a two-day tutorial introducing R programming in computational biology. Even though R is not quite prominent among so many programming languages,  its unique characteristics in statistical computing and graphics by the foundation makes it widely spread in both mathematic and biology area. So, in the systems biology field. R is hard to be replaced with any other language because of its a missive variety of packages in “Comprehensive **R** Archive Network” ( [**CRAN**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html) ) and [**Bioconductor**](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/). (These two links give out all the available packages in both database). 

Besides, most of well developed R packages provide very detailed documentation or manuals assisting your coding. For instance, the manual of [ChemmineR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/ChemmineR/inst/doc/ChemmineR.html) is in HTML format and the user's guide of [edgeR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/edgeR/inst/doc/edgeRUsersGuide.pdf) is in a well formatted PDF file. All of the files can be accessed online, and provide more than enough explanations and examples to help one to understand relevant operations. Therefore, just with basic R programming knowledge, according to these guides, one can smoothly go through complex analysis. This is the task of this two-day course that helps one who does not know R can grasp the essential operation of R and one who knows R can master R more efficiently.

***Tips***: In the HTML files, there are some inline hyperlinks provide more detailed explanations and examples about specific terms; some homework is demonstrated with R and you can check from [here](https://cuij.netlify.app/)

## Requirements

* Install [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) in your computer. These two software is available for all OS, and if you have difficulties installing them, please let me know.
* One can download this Repository by pulling down the green **Code** button and choosing **Download ZIP**. Then one will have all the materials we are going to use in the class.
* Please enjoy the Homework :)
