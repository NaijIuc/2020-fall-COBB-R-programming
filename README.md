This is a two-day tutorial introducing R programming in computational biology. Even though R is not quite outstanding among so many programming languages,  its unique characteristics in statistical computing and graphics by the foundation makes it widely spread in both mathematic and biology area. So, in the systems biology field. R is hard to be replaced with any other language because of its a missive variety of packages in “Comprehensive **R** Archive Network” ( [**CRAN**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/available_packages_by_date.html) ) and [**Bioconductor**](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/). (These two links give out all the available packages in both database). 

Besides, most of well developed R packages provide very detailed documentation or manuals assisting your coding. For instance, the manual of [ChemmineR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/ChemmineR/inst/doc/ChemmineR.html) is in HTML format and the user's guide of [edgeR](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/edgeR/inst/doc/edgeRUsersGuide.pdf) is in a well formatted PDF file. All of the files can be accessed online, and provide more than enough explanations and examples to help one to understand relevant messages.
